## Next.js Routing: Use App Router

- Use App Router instead of Pages Router

## Project structure

Project structure will follow Feature-Sliced Design. Read this documentation thoroughly: https://feature-sliced.design/docs

/src
/app # Global settings, routing
/pages # Route-level pages (Home, Dashboard, About us, etc.)
/widgets # Common UI blocks for pages (Navbar, Footer, etc.)
/features # Feature-specific modules (Sign-up, Event management, etc.)
/entities # Domain model-specific functionality (Data-related logic)
/shared # Common modules (Utilities, API helpers, shared UI components)

## Use TypeScript for entire Project

## Component: Use ShadCN if available

- All components should be made by ShadCN components
- The command is `npx shadcn@latest add`
- Components should be re-usable as much as possible

## Supabase

Always reference to its documentation: https://supabase.com/docs
